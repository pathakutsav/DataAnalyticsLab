1) Read Json file (labtask5_file)using R data frame
2) Find average salary, standard deviation, median for all employees
3) Project 2 year salary for each employee where salary increases 10% on an average every year
4) Express earnings as a percentage of salary for each employee
5) Plot a linear line of Earnings vs Salary
6) Perform a linear regression of Earnings vs Salary.
7) Predict earnings for each of employee salary
8) Record difference in predicted earnings vs actual earnings
9) Is linear a good fit for this problem? Explain 



Sample code
setwd("C:/..............") 
library("rjson") 
input <- fromJSON(file = "labtask4_file.json") 
df = as.data.frame(input) 

df$ID <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(as.character(df$ID), ","), function(x) x[1])) 
df$Salary <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(as.character(df$Salary), ","), function(x) x[1])) 
df$Earnings <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(as.character(df$Earnings), ","), function(x) x[1])) 

#average salary 
mean(df$Salary, na.rm = TRUE) 

#standard deviation 
sd(df$Salary, na.rm = TRUE) 

#Median 
median(df$Salary, na.rm = TRUE) 

#Earnings As A Percentage Of Salary For Each Employee 

for (x in 1:25){ 
  print(paste("Earning As Percentage Of Salary For Employee",x, " = ",(df$Earnings[x] / df$Salary[x]) * 100,"%")) 
} 

#Linear Line Of Earnings Vs Salary 
x = df$Salary 
y = df$Earnings 

plot(x,y, col="blue", xlab="Salary", ylab="Earnings", main="Earnings vs Salary Regression") 

abline(lm(y~x), col="Red")
