For the given spreadsheet, perform following operations
1) Read both files "samplefile..........." into a dataframe
2) Add a column to compute net revenue price where revenue = ((production in tonnes) * unit cost) + 0.1 * ((production in tonnes) * unit cost)) for Sugar
3) Add a column to compute net revenue price where revenue = ((production in tonnes) * unit cost) + 0.085 * ((production in tonnes) * unit cost)) for Maize

3) Plot a histogram of production in tonnes both for Sugar and Maize
4) Find average, median of sugar & Maize production in tonnes
5) Find average, median of revenue both for Sugar and Maize

6) Perform a linear correlation of the revenues of Sugar and Maize. Make inferences on the obtained value? Is linear correlation valid? 
Sample code.............result = cor(x, y, method = "pearson")

6) Perform a linear regression in one variable of  revenue vs maize production in tonnes
7) Perform a linear regression in one variable of  revenue vs sugar production in tonnes
..........use lm(Y~x)
8) Obtain intercept and slope for both the lines and plot t against x for both cases 7 and 8. Is linear regression suitable here?
