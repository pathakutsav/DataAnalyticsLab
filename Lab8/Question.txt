1. Quick view the Iris data
library(datasets)
head(iris, n=100)

2. Check structure of iris
str(iris)   

3. Determine the relation between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width using a scatter plot

4. Determine the relation between Petal.Length and Petal.Width using a scatter plot

5. Perform multi regression analysis by setting Sepal.Length as target variable and Sepal.Width,Petal.Length,Petal.Width as dependent variables
Eg. model <- lm(SL ~ SW + PL + ...............) 

6. Obtain the linear multi variate equation. Find the error in preduction by comparing actual Sepal Length against predicted Sepal Length using the obtained equation.

Write your detailed observation along with plots for each steps from 3 - 6
